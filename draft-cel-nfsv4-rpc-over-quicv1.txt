               Remote Procedure Call Over QUIC Version 1
                 draft-cel-nfsv4-rpc-over-quicv1-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a protocol for conveying Remote Procedure
   (RPC) messages on QUIC version 1 connections.  It requires no
   revision to application RPC protocols or the RPC protocol itself.

1.  Introduction


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Implementation Status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.

   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   There are no known implementations of RPC-over-QUICv1 as it is
   described in the current document.

4.  Security Considerations


5.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Editor: In the following subsections, please replace RFC-TBD with
   the RFC number assigned to this document.  Furthermore, please remove
   this Editor's Note before this document is published.

5.1.  Netids for RPC-Over-QUICv1

   Each new RPC transport is assigned one or more RPC "netid" strings.
   These strings are an rpcbind [RFC1833] string naming the underlying
   transport protocol, appropriate message framing, and the format of
   service addresses and ports, among other things.

   The authors request that IANA allocate the following "Netid" registry
   strings in the "ONC RPC Netid" registry, as defined in [RFC5666]:

   <CODE BEGINS>
         NC_QUIC "quic"
         NC_QUIC6 "quic6"
   <CODE ENDS>

   These netids MUST be used for any transport satisfying the
   requirements described in the current document.  The "quic" netid is
   to be used when IPv4 addressing is employed by the underlying
   transport, and "quic6" for IPv6 addressing.  IANA should use the
   current document (RFC-TBD) as the reference for the new entries.
